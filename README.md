# R code Repository for 'From Mind to Matter: Patterns of Innovation in the Archaeological Record and the Ecology of Social Learning'

The code provided here allows interested readers to further examine the agent-based simulation presented in this study and modify the parameter settings to ask new questions.

There are two R scripts included in this repository. The first provides some useful functions for plotting the model outputs. The second is the code for the model itself. In this second script, we provide code for both a single run and multi-run version of the model.  
Note that when the simulation is set for five runs at a population size of 1,000 for 5,000 generations, as is presented in this script, the run time on the authors' laptop computer (Dell Latitude 7420) takes around 30 min. Increasing population size, the number of runs, or the number of generations increases the run time.  

### Files:

* PlotFunction.r - Some functions for plotting the model output
* SingleRunCode.R - Code for running and plotting just one run of the model
* MultirunLineplots.R - Code for running and plotting multiple runs of the model

Also note that both scripts require users to have the 'tidyverse' suite of packages installed.
